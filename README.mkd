DEPRECATED, no longer developed under this repo. 

If you're looking for my implementation, 
please go to [Ionide-nvim](https://github.com/WillEhrendreich/Ionide-nvim) instead. 

If you want the official ionide plugin go to 
[Ionide-vim](https://github.com/ionide/Ionide-vim). 

I'm only keeping this repo around for history.
